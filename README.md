# RawTree Agent Skills

Agent Skills for RawTree-focused AI workflows.

This repository is also a portable Agent Plugins package. Kiro can install it
as the RawTree Power, while other compatible coding agents can continue to
discover the skills under `skills/`.

```

## Available Skills

- `rawtree` — RawTree API and CLI guidance sourced from `backend/src/routes/docs.rs`.

## Kiro Power

The root `plugin.json` follows Agent Plugins 1.0 and makes this repository
installable as a Kiro Power. The existing `skills/rawtree/SKILL.md` remains the
single source of truth for RawTree guidance. Kiro's
`steering/rawtree.md` is a generated adapter for installations that do not
register bundled Agent Skills in the IDE panel.

The root `POWER.md` provides Kiro's legacy presentation metadata, including
the human-readable display name **RawTree**, description, keywords, and author.
It is retained for compatibility with local Power installation while
`plugin.json` remains the portable package manifest.

The root `mcp.json` uses the Agent Plugins 1.0 MCP schema and connects the
Power to RawTree's hosted Streamable HTTP MCP server at
`https://mcp.rawtree.com/mcp`. Kiro manages the MCP connection and
authentication. No API keys or authorization headers are stored in this
repository.

The repository also includes `icon.png`, RawTree's branded Power asset. Kiro's
custom GitHub and local Power imports currently use a generic placeholder icon;
the asset is available for registry curation or a local Kiro registry entry.

For local MCP development, continue to use the setup in the
[`rawtree-mcp` repository](https://github.com/rawtreedb/rawtree-mcp), which
supports both stdio and a local HTTP server.

### Synchronizing Kiro steering

When `skills/rawtree/SKILL.md` changes, regenerate the Kiro adapter:

```bash
python3 scripts/sync_kiro_steering.py
python3 scripts/sync_kiro_steering.py --check
```

### Install in Kiro

In Kiro, open **Powers → Add Custom Power → Import power from GitHub** and
provide this repository URL. For local testing, use **Import power from a
folder** after cloning the repository.
